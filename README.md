The main project page is here: http://bit.ly/1Q61xv9

This repository holds a copy of the source files, schematics, etc (in addition to http://bit.ly/1Q61xv9)

There is also a blog post here (http://www.itcamefromtheworkshop.com/2016/02/star-wars-droid-translator-helmets.html) with some added technical background, and this post describing in depth how hard it was to make a convincing-sounding "Droid" language sample set -- in TWO different voices, no less!
